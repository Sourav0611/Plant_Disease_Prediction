Classifies plant diseases from images using a CNN-based deep learning model. 

  *  Data Processing: Extracts and organizes the plant disease dataset; preprocesses images for training and validation.
    
  *  Model Training: Builds and trains a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of plant
     diseases.
     
  *  Predictive System: Implements functions to preprocess images and predict disease classes using the trained deep
     learning model.
     
  *  Interactive UI: Allows users to upload images and receive disease predictions through a Streamlit app.
    
  *  Tech Stack: TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit, NumPy, Pandas, PIL, Matplotlib, JSON, Git.
